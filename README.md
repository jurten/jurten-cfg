# Description
This repository should have everything to replicate my workspace. The setup is though to be heavy on shortcuts, easy to use, reliable and fast. Many configuration files are written on lua.

## Contents
This repository includes configurations for:
- Awesome
- Kitty
- Neovim
- Rofi
- Zathura
- zsh
- .xprofile

There are shortcuts set for:
- Brave
- Flameshot
- goneovim
- Steam

## Mentions
This setup is heavily inspired by friends of mine, to whom I owe a huge part of the end result of this repository. Huge thanks to the two of you.

## Final thoughts
I plan to solve the bug that makes awesome fail to open files using goneovim. I also plan to add polybar, but now it's fully usable so that's why I'm sharing it.
Please don't dubt to report any bug or broken feature you see. I will try to address it as soon as posible.
